Description: Library of various useful C++ code
 libwibble collects the foundation code that has been used over time
 in various C++ projects by Peter Rockai and Enrico Zini, so that it can
 be maintained properly and in a single place.
 .
 The library contains:
  * an exception hierarchy;
  * various useful mixin classes;
  * shortcuts for set operations;
  * a commandline parser that supports cvs-style subcommands;
  * improved macros for tut unit testing;
  * a non-intrusive polimorphic envelope.
