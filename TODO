   one by one.  There is not even a way to count the arguments without popping
   them one by one.
 - See if it's worth removing the manpage support, since help2man does it
   properly.  On the other hand, help2man doesn't probably do multi-command
   help pages.
commandline::options
 + There is no way to distinguish between a missing int value and a 0 int value
   Alias boolValue as 'defined', or add a 'defined' method
